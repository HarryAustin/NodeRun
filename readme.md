# NodeRun

## Description
A mini clone of nodemon to help restart command processes when file changes.
Just like how nodemon runs by using "nodemom filename", same way to run noderun

## How to use it
1) download or clone the project.
    git clone https://github.com/HarryAustin/NodeRun.git

2) run noderun Folder/filename.js 
    currently listening for only files with "js" extension.

3) Change files, save and allow noderun restart the process for you.

## Inspiration

Building this as my first node project after starting to learn node, i choose noderun as my first project to get to see how libraries were being built or how nodemon was built from the back lol, and with nodemon as one of the fascinating and common library to use by both frontend developers and backend developers, why wouldnt i want to learn one or two on how such a library is being built? lol.
And also it was a good way for me to learn how command line commands works with their processes and child processes.

## Tools

1) Js
2) Node.js
3) Processes
4) child processes
5) chokidar


## Credits
credits to "Programylis" youtube channel whom i got an idea from on how these libraries work most especially noderun.
